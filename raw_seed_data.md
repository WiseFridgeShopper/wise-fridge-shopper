Quotes
  Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.
  When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.
  You have power over your mind - not oustide events. Realize this, and you will find strength.
  Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind.
  One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.
  If you do not tell the truth about yourself you cannot tell it about other people.
  You can never be overdressed or overeducated.
  I don't want to go to heaven. None of my friends are there.
  Women are meant to be loved, not to be understood.
  To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

  What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.
  What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.
  Our life is frittered away by detail. Simplify, simplify.
  We must walk consciously only part way toward our goal and then leap in the dark to our success.
  People who say it cannot be done should not interrupt those who are doing it.

  Marcus Aurelius
  If ever there was an exemplification of Plato's 'Philosopher King', it would be Marcus Aurelius. Born in 121, he became a Roman Emperor in 161, and his reign lasted until his death in 180. An ardent Stoic, he is best remembered today as the author of the Meditations, a collection of 'spiritual exercises' that were written for himself between 170 and 180. Fortunately for us, this work was preserved for posterity, and it can be read profitably today by anyone looking for a source of spiritual guidance.

  Virginia Woolf
  Born in 1882 in London, Virginia Woolf was an author and essayist today regarded as one of the twentieth century's literary greats. Her most well known works include the novels Mrs Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, Orlando, and the book-length essay A Room of One's Own.

  Ralph Waldo Emerson
  Born in 1803 in Boston, Massachusetts, Ralph Waldo Emerson was arguably the most influential writer of 19th-century America. Regarded by many as the American version of Michel de Montaigne, Emerson wrote voluminously on a wide range of subjects. Some of his most important essays include Nature, Self-Reliance, and Experience.

  Henry David Thoreau
  Henry David Thoreau, born in 1817 in Concord, Massachusetts, was a man who wore man hats. A poet, philosopher, abolitionist, tax resister, and naturalist, Thoreau is one of America's most celebrated and famous authors. In addition to his classic book Walden, which recounts his two-year experience living a simple existence amongst nature, Thoreau is also perhaps known for his essay Civil Disobedience, which has inspired protest movements around the world and influenced everyone from Mohandas Gandhi to Leo Tolstoy and Martin Luther King, Jr.

  Oscar Wilde
  The Irish writer and poet Oscar Wilde was born in 1854 and died in 1900. A celebrated playwright known for his wit and flamboyant dress, his best known play was The Importance of Being Earnest, which poked fun at the customs of Victorian England, while his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, was controversial for its judgments on hedonism and morality.

  George Bernard Shaw
  George Bernard Shaw was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1856, and died in England in 1950. An esteemed playwright, essayist and novelist, Shaw's works highlighted the social problems of his day, particularly what he regarded as the exploitation of the working class. As a fervent socialist, Shaw wrote many tracts promoting this ideology, but it was his literary prowess that saw him reach the heights of professional recognition, receiving both a Nobel Prize and an Oscar, the only person in history to have received both awards.
